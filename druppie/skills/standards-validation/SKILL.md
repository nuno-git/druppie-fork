# Standards Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate generated code against Druppie's project
coding standards and architecture patterns. Check each item and report
findings in the structured output format below.

---

## 1. Architecture Compliance

### Layer Separation

- [ ] **Routes are thin** — no business logic in route handlers, only:
  parse request → call service → return response
- [ ] **Business logic in services** — authorization checks, validation,
  orchestration all happen in the service layer
- [ ] **Database access in repositories only** — no `self.db.query()` in
  services or routes
- [ ] **No circular dependencies** — Route → Service → Repository (never
  reverse)

### Domain Model Pattern

- [ ] **Summary/Detail pattern used** — every entity has `<Entity>Summary`
  (lightweight, for lists) and `<Entity>Detail` (inherits Summary, for
  single-item views)
- [ ] **Detail inherits from Summary** — `class <Entity>Detail(<Entity>Summary)`
- [ ] **All domain models exported** through `druppie/domain/__init__.py`
- [ ] **Pydantic BaseModel** — all domain models inherit from `BaseModel`

### Repository Pattern

- [ ] **Extends BaseRepository** — `class XxxRepository(BaseRepository)`
- [ ] **Returns domain models** — public query methods (list, get_detail)
  return Pydantic domain models, not ORM models
- [ ] **Has `_to_summary` / `_to_detail` helpers** — private methods that
  convert ORM model → domain model
- [ ] **Raw ORM access** — `get_by_id` returns ORM model (for internal use
  by other repository methods and services)

### Dependency Injection

- [ ] **Wired through deps.py** — `get_<entity>_repository()` and
  `get_<entity>_service()` functions exist in `druppie/api/deps.py`
- [ ] **Uses `Depends()`** — routes inject services via
  `service: XxxService = Depends(get_xxx_service)`
- [ ] **Constructor injection** — services receive repositories via
  constructor, not via global imports

### Frontend Architecture

- [ ] **Page in `src/pages/`** — page components in the correct directory
- [ ] **Components in `src/components/`** — reusable components properly
  organized
- [ ] **API calls via `src/services/api.js`** — not inline fetch calls
- [ ] **React Query for server state** — uses `useQuery` / `useMutation`
  from `@tanstack/react-query`

---

## 2. Code Style Compliance

### Python

- [ ] **Black-compatible formatting** — 100 character line length
- [ ] **Type hints on all public functions** — parameters and return types
- [ ] **Google-style docstrings** — on all public classes and functions
- [ ] **structlog logging** — `logger = structlog.get_logger()` at module
  level, structured key-value logging
- [ ] **No bare `except:`** — always specify exception type
- [ ] **Correct import order** — stdlib → third-party → local (Ruff I rule)

### Frontend

- [ ] **Functional components only** — no class components
- [ ] **Tailwind CSS** — styling via utility classes, not CSS modules
- [ ] **ESLint clean** — no warnings (enforced with `--max-warnings 0`)

### Naming Conventions

- [ ] **Python functions/variables** — `snake_case`
- [ ] **Python classes** — `PascalCase`
- [ ] **Python files** — `snake_case.py`
- [ ] **React components** — `PascalCase` names, `PascalCase.jsx` files
- [ ] **JavaScript variables/functions** — `camelCase`
- [ ] **API route prefixes** — plural nouns (`/projects`, `/sessions`)

## 3. Critical Violations (Must Fail Review)

These issues automatically result in a **FAIL** verdict:

| Violation | Why It Fails |
|-----------|-------------|
| **JSON/JSONB column** in any SQLAlchemy model | Project rule: normalize into relational tables |
| **Database migration file** (Alembic, etc.) | Project rule: update models directly, reset DB |
| **Legacy/fallback code** (backwards compat hacks, unused `_vars`) | Project rule: clean architecture only |
| **Business logic in route handlers** (DB queries, complex conditionals) | Architecture: routes must be thin |
| **Direct DB access in services** (`self.db.query(...)` in a service) | Architecture: only repositories touch DB |
| **Missing `__init__.py` exports** for new domain models | Convention: central export required |
| **Class components** in React | Convention: functional components only |

---

## 4. Template Usage Verification

When the Builder created new components, verify the correct templates were
followed:

- [ ] **Domain model** follows Summary/Detail pattern with Pydantic
- [ ] **DB model** extends `Base`, uses `UUID(as_uuid=True)` for primary key,
  has `created_at` / `updated_at` timestamps
- [ ] **Repository** extends `BaseRepository`, has conversion helpers
- [ ] **Service** receives repository via constructor injection
- [ ] **Route** uses `Depends()` for service injection, returns domain models
- [ ] **deps.py** has both repository and service factory functions
- [ ] **Frontend page** uses React Query, Tailwind CSS

## Review Process

1. **Invoke skills** — load `project-coding-standards` and this
   `standards-validation` skill
2. **Read the code** — use `coding_read_file` and `coding_list_dir` to
   inspect all generated files
3. **Apply checklists** — go through each section above
4. **Check for critical violations** — any violation in section 3 means
   automatic FAIL
5. **Write REVIEW.md** — using the output format above
6. **Commit and push** — save REVIEW.md to git
7. **Call done()** — with summary including verdict and key findings
